# Angular 2 Test Site

This is merely a test implementation of a basic Angular 2 website without routing at this time. This is based on a Bootstrap template ([Basic Template by BlackTie.co](http://blacktie.co/2014/10/basic-personal-page/)), so I take no credit for the design or styling or any of that.
I merely converted this template to an Angular 2 framework.

After cloning the project to your desired location, `cd` into the project folder and then run:

`npm install`

This will install all of the project dependencies. Next run:

`npm run typings install`

This will install the typings files to use with Typescript.

Once you have those installed you can run the following to start the development server.

`npm start`

This will launch the dev site in your default browser at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
